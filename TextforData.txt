he found himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin.
He lay on his armour-like back and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly
slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff section 
"What's happened to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream
His room, a proper human room although a little too small
lay peacefully between its four familiar walls
A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table 
and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine
 Doing business like this takes much more effort than doing your own business at home
 and on top of that there's the curse of travelling
worries about making train connections bad and irregular food contact
He slid back into his former position
"Getting up early all the time", he thought, "it makes you stupid
You've got to get enough sleep
Other travelling salesmen live a life of luxury
And he looked over at the alarm clock, ticking on the chest of drawers
He was still hurriedly thinking all this through unable to decide to get out of the bed
when the clock struck quarter to seven
There was a cautious knock at the door near his head.
short conversation made the other members of the family aware that 
 against their expectations was still at home and soon his father came knocking at one of the side doors
The first thing he wanted to do was to get up in peace without being disturbed
to get dressed and most of all to have his breakfast
 Only then would he consider what to do next, as he was well aware that he would not bring
It was a simple matter to throw off the covers
he only had to blow himself up a little and they fell off by themselves
But it became difficult after that, especially as he was so exceptionally broad
 He would have used his arms and his hands to push himself up
The first thing he wanted to do was get the lower part of his body out of the bed
but he had never seen this lower part, and could not imagine what it looked like
it turned out to be too hard to move it went so slowly and finally
almost in a frenzy when he carelessly shoved himself forwards with all the force he
So then he tried to get the top part of his body out of the bed first
carefully turning his head to the side this he managed quite easily
and despite its breadth and its weight the bulk of his body eventually followed slowly
It took just as much effort to get back to where he had been earlier, but when he lay there sighing
and was once more watching his legs as they struggled against each other even harder than before
But then he said to himself: "Before it strikes quarter past seven I'll definitely
have to have got properly out of bed. And by then somebody will have come round
When Gregor was already sticking half way out of the bed - the new method 
was more of a game than an effort, all he had to do was rock back and forth
 it occurred to him how simple everything would be if somebody came to help him
The chief clerk now raised his voice
You barricade yourself in your room, give us no more than yes or no for an answer
 you are causing serious and unnecessary concern to your parents
is your position all that secure I had originally intended to say all this to you in private
but since you cause me to waste my time here for no good reason I don't see 
why your parents should not also learn of it
beside himself and forgetting all else in the excitement
 just a moment. I'm slightly unwell, an attack of dizziness, I haven't been able to get up
You don't need to wait, sir; I'll be in the office soon after you
and please be so good as to tell that to the boss and recommend me to him
And while Gregor gushed out these words, hardly knowing what he was saying
he made his way over to the chest of drawers - this was easily done
probably because of the practise he had already had in bed 
By now he had also calmed down, and kept quiet so that he could listen to what the chief clerk was saying
the chief clerk asked his parents surely he's not trying to make fools of us
Gregor, in contrast, had become much calmer. So they couldn't understand his words 
any more, although they seemed clear enough to him, clearer than before
perhaps his ears had become used to the sound. They had realised
were all pressed against the door and listening
Gregor slowly pushed his way over to the door with the chair
Once there he let go of it and threw himself onto the door
holding himself upright against it using the adhesive on the tips of his legs
 He rested there a little while to recover from

paying no attention to the pain he was causing himself. As the key turned round he turned around the lock
Because he had to open the door in this way, it was already wide open before he could be seen
He had first to slowly turn himself around one of the double doors and he had to do it very carefully 
Then he looked uncertainly round the living room, covered his eyes with his hands and wept 
So Gregor did not go into the room, but leant against the inside of the other door 
which was still held bolted in place. In this way only half of his body could be seen
along with his head above it which he leant over to one side as he peered
The door to the entrance hall was open and as the front door of the flat was 
also open he could see onto the landing and the stairs where they began their way down below
said Gregor, well aware that he was the only one to have kept calm
Will you please just let me leave
 I know that nobody likes the travellers
They think we earn an enormous wage as well as having a soft time of it
That's just prejudice but they have no particular reason to think better of it
But the chief clerk had turned away as soon as Gregor had started
to speak, and, with protruding lips, only stared back at him over his trembling shoulders as
He did not keep still for a moment while Gregor was speaking but moved
Gregor realised that it was out of the question to let the chief clerk go away in this mood if his
position in the firm was not to be put into extreme danger that was something his

but the unthinking way she was hurrying backwards showed that she did not
He had completely forgotten the chief clerk for the moment but could not help himself snapping
in the air with his jaws at the sight of the flow of coffee that set his mother screaming
picked up a large newspaper from the table with his left and used them to drive
but he was afraid that if he took the time to do that his father would become impatient
and there was the threat of a lethal blow to his back or head from the stick in his father's hand any moment
was too narrow, and his body was too broad to get through it without further difficulty
In his present mood, it obviously did not occur to his father to open the other of the double doors so that
the little legs along one side hung quivering in the air while those on
the other side were pressed painfully against the ground. Then his father gave him a hefty shove
from behind which released him from where he was held and sent him flying
It was not until it was getting dark that evening that Gregor awoke from his deep and coma-like sleep
 He would have woken soon afterwards anyway even if he hadn't been disturbed
as he had had enough sleep and felt fully rested
It was only when he had reached the door that he realised what it actually was that
had drawn him over to it; it was the smell of something to eat. By the door there was a dish filled
Through the crack in the door, Gregor could see that the gas had been lit in the living room
His father at this time would normally be sat with his evening paper, reading it out in a loud voice

sister would often write and tell him about this reading, but maybe
Even before the first day had come to an end, his father had explained
mother and sister what their finances and prospects were
When explaining things, his father repeated himself several times
partly because it was a long time since he had been occupied with these matters
This money, however, was certainly not enough to enable the family to live off the interest
it was enough to maintain them for, perhaps, one or two years, no more
most of all playing the violin. Whenever they began to talk of the need to earn money
Gregor would always first let go of the door and then throw himself onto the cool, leather sofa next to it
as he became quite hot with shame and regret
He would often lie there the whole night through, not sleeping a wink but scratching at the
Or he might go to all the effort of pushing a chair to the window, climbing up onto the
If Gregor had only been able to speak to his sister and thank her for all that she
had to do for him it would have been easier for him to bear it
but as it was it caused him pain. His sister, naturally
tried as far as possible to pretend there
liked to spare him this ordeal, but it was impossible for her to be in the same room
One day, about a month after Gregor's transformation when his sister
no longer had any particular reason to be shocked at his appearance
she came into the room a little earlier than usual and found him still staring out the window
One day, in order to spare her even this sight, he spent four hours 
carrying the bedsheet over to the couch on his back and arranged
it so that he was completely covered and his sister would not be able to see him 
For the first fourteen days, Gregor's parents could not bring themselves 
different visual representations to show the relationship
come into the room to see him
He would often hear them say how they appreciated 
all the new work his sister was doing even though
hink to himself that maybe it would be better if his mother came in
not every day of course, but one day a week, perhaps; she could understand
everything much better than his sister who, for all her courage
wish to see his mother was soon realised. Out of consideration for his parents
Gregor wanted to avoid being seen at the window during the day
the few square meters of the floor did not give him much room to crawl about
he crawled about - and got it into her head to make it as easy as possible for him
